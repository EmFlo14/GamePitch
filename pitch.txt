Game idea:

A scrolling world creepy game where the main character is in a spooky forest and trying to get through the levels by avoiding getting killed by monsters.



Scenario and character descriptions:

The entire scenery would be black and white but not the main character and the monsters. The main character would have a flashlight which would scare off
the monsters. 



Character’s actions and goals:

The character would jump on different ledges and branches in the forest to try to avoid the monsters, and shine the flashlight at them to kill them. If
the light is shined on the monsters for long enough, they die. The flashlight will run out of power so the player will have to go find a new flashlight
when the current one is getting darker and darker. These flashlights will be found at different places in the forest. 



Win/lose conditions:

To win, the character will have to reach the end of the world. If the character gets touched by a monster 5 times, they die. 



Source of inspiration:

I was inspired by the video games Limbo and Little Nightmares.



What I’m looking for in a teammate:

Someone who is willing to work as hard as they can in order to help create the best game possible, but also someone who is very organized and, depending 
of the different strengths of each specific teammate, does their part of the work and asks for and/or gives help if needed.
